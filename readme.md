# Bisque

A Chrome extension that helps writers get things done by managing their time, measuring their productivity, and avoiding distractions.

- Track raw output (words per minute) on browser-based text editors, like Google Docs
- Customize a "greylist", to identify the sources of your largest distractions
- Graph your productivity over time to find hours, weeks, or months when you aren't getting as much done
- Schedule work and break periods to minimize fatigue
- Chrome notifications let you know when it's time for a stretch or time to focus in
- ...and even more features coming soon!

Our presentation on the project can be seen here:

# Instructions

```
git clone https://github.com/dgodow/bisque
npm install
npm start
```

Open Chrome's extensions panel and click `Load unpacked extension...`. Browse to your Bisque directory, highlight the `build` folder and press `Select`. Click on the lobster claw-shaped app icon to login via Google.

Now you're all set! Set your timers and greylists then get to work: flesh out your dissertation, finish that report or begin writing the Great American Novel!

For development purposes, Bisque's timer is currently running at 10-20 times speed.
